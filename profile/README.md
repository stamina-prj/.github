# STAMINA - EU Horizon 2020 
The goal of the **STAMINA** project is to develop an intelligent decision support platform for pandemic prediction and management. STAMINA is a joint effort of 39 European partners towards designing new technologies to enable national agencies and first responders to anticipate pandemic threats and plan daily efforts to enhance health security. The objectives of the project include the creation of real-time web and social media analytics for the detection of possible disease outbreaks, predictive modelling of pandemic outbreaks and early warning systems. The crisis management part will define the roles of key actors during crisis management and include protection and diagnostic devices for first-line screening. Finally, STAMINA will develop a common operational picture as the main interface that enables coordinated response and demonstrate its application within and across EU borders.
